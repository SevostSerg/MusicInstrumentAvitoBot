# MusicInstrumentAvitoBot
Music instrument bot for Avito.  My first C# project. 

The essence is quite simple - the bot parses the page (specify the link in the config) and, depending on the information in the configuration files, sends messages to the specified id. It is clear that this is all garbage, but do not judge strictly, in fact this is one of my first experiences of writing code in general.  
 In the future, it is planned to switch to a generalized version, with which it will be possible to monitor anything on Avito.  
 By the way, this allowed me to write the first seller in the ad quite a lot of times ;-)
